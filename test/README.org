#+title: guile-toml tests


* toml-test suite

To run the ~toml-test~ suite, install ~toml-test~ by following the instructions [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test/#installation][here]]. Running the tests also depends on [[https://github.com/aconchillo/guile-json][guile-json]], so make sure to have it installed.

To test the decoder, run:
#+begin_src shell
$ toml-test ./test-decoder.scm
#+end_src

To test the encoder, run:
#+begin_src shell
$ toml-test -encoder ./test-encoder.scm
#+end_src

* tests for Guile's datatypes

The ~toml-test~ suite tests TOML's structure extensively, but since it relies on JSON and a different encoding of values, we still need to test whether Guile's datatypes are decoded and encoded correctly.

[TODO]

The files ~decoder.scm~ and ~encoder.scm~ serve as examples for this. They take input from STDIN and output to STDOUT.
